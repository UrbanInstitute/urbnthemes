R is a powerful, open-source programming language and environment. R excels at data management and munging, traditional statistical analysis, machine learning, and reproducible research, but it is probably best known for its graphics. This .html file made with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) contains examples and instructions for popular and lesser-known plotting techniques in R. Furthermore, it includes instructions on how to leverage the Urban Institute's ggplot2 theme which will create near-publication-ready plots. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Aaron Williams (awilliams@urban.org) or Kyle Ueyama (kueyama@urban.org). 

#### Using the Urban Institute ggplot2 Theme

Depending on your operating system, run one of the following scripts once per R session:

**Windows**
```
source('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UrbanInstitute/urban_R_theme/master/urban_theme_windows.R')
```

**Mac**
```
source('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UrbanInstitute/urban_R_theme/master/urban_theme_mac.R')
```

This is an `R` script that makes `ggplot2` output align more closely with [the Urban Institute's Data Visualization style guide](http://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/).

* This script does **not produce publication ready graphics**. Visual styles must still be edited using your project/paper's normal editing workflow.
	*  ***Exporting charts as a pdf will allow them to be more easily edited***
	*  You may need to tweak pdf export options to preserve fonts. For example, in RStudio on OSX, check this option in the export pdf window: `r knitr::include_graphics("images/pdf_export_option.png")`

* The theme has been tested against `ggplot2 version 2.2.1`. It will not function properly with older (`< 2.0.0`) versions of `ggplot2`

* If it is not already installed, please install the free [Lato font from Google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato).
  * If you're on Windows, you'll first need to [install Ghostscript](http://ghostscript.com/download/). You may need to have IT enter an admin password for this installation. Then, in R, tell R where your ghostscript file is.
  * Edit the file path if yours is in a different place
```
Sys.setenv(R_GSCMD="C:/Program Files/gs/gs9.05/bin/gswin32c.exe")`
```

**Run this script once:**

```
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "ggrepel", "RColorBrewer", "extrafont"))
library(extrafont)
port()
loadfonts()
```

Loading and importing fonts may take a few minutes.

After the initial installation, to use Lato just load the library in each R session:
```
library(extrafont)
```

#### Grammar of Graphics and Conventions

Hadley Wickham's ggplot2 is based on Leland Wilkinson's [*The Grammar of Graphics*](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448) and Wickham's [*A Layered Grammar of Graphics*](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html). The layered grammar of graphics is a structured way of thinking about the components of a plot, which then lend themselves to the simple structure of ggplot2. 

* **Data** are what are visualizaed in a plot and **mappings** are directions for how data are mapped in a plot in a way that can be perceived by humans.  
* **Geoms** are representations of the actual data like points, lines, and bars. 
* **Stats** are statistical transformations that represent summaries of the data like histograms. 
* **Scales** map values in the data space to values in the aesthetic space. Scales draw legends and axes.
* **Coordinate Systems** describe how geoms are mapped to the plane of the graphic.  
* **Facets** break the data into meaningful subsets like small multiples. 
* **Themes** control the finer points of a plot such as fonts, font sizes, and background colors. 

More information: [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403) 

#### Tips and Tricks

* `ggplot2` expects data to be in data frames. It is preferable for the data frames to be "tidy" with each variable as a column, each obseravtion as a row, and each observational unit as a separate table. `dplyr` and `tidyr` contain concise and effective tools for "tidying" data.

* R allows function arguments to be called explicitly by name and implicitly by position. The coding examples in this guide only contain named arguments for clarity.

* Continuous legends should be switched to vertical using `theme(legend.direction = "vertical")`.

* Graphics will sometimes render differently on different operating systems. This is because anti-aliasing is activated in R on Mac and Linux but not activated in R on Windows. [This blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/exporting-nice-plots-in-r/) outlines several fixes for this problem.

* Most features of plots can be adjusted by adding `theme()` to the end of a ggplot call. For example, a plot with a continuous legend would look like this:

```
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  stat_binhex(aes(colour = ..count..)) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",
        legend.direction = "vertical")
```

## Bar Plots

------

### One Color

```{r barplots}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 20)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Cars By Number of Cylinders",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Count") +
  remove_ticks()
```

### Three Colors 

This is identical to the previous plot except colors and a legend are added with `fill = factor(cyl)`. Turning `x` into a factor with `factor(cyl)` skips 5 and 7 on the `x-axis`. Adding `fill = cyl` without `factor()` would have created a continuous color scheme and legend.   

``` {r 3-color-barplot}
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = factor(cyl), fill = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Cars By Number of Cylinders",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Number of Cylinders",
       y = "Count"
       ) 
```

### Stacked Bar Plot

An additional aesthetic can easily be added to bar plots by adding `fill = categorical variable` to the mapping. Here, diamond quality subsets each bar showing the count of diamonds with each level of clarity. 

```{r stacked-bar-plot}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = clarity, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 15000), labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(
    title = "Diamond Clarity",
    subtitle = "Something Informative About Diamonds",
    caption = "The Source of Diamond Data",
    x = "Clarity",
    y = "Count"
    )
```

### Stacked Bar Plot With Position = Fill

`position = "fill"` in `geom_bar()` changes the y-axis from count to the proportion of each bar. 

```{r stacked-bar-plot-fill}
#5 colors (stacked)
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = clarity, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(title = "Better Cut Diamonds have Better Clarity",
      subtitle = "Share of Diamonds with Different Qualities by Clarity of Cut",
      caption = "The Source of Diamond Data",
      x = "Clarity",
      y = "Count")
```

### Dodged Bar Plot

Subsetted bar charts in ggplot2 are stacked by default. `position = "dodge"` in `geom_bar()` expands the bar chart so the bars appear next to each other.

```{r dodged-bar-plot}
#5 colors (dodged)
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(clarity, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 6000), labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Diamond Clarity",
       subtitle = "Something Informative About Diamonds",
       caption = "The Source of Diamond Data",
       x = "Clarity",
       y = "Count")
```

### Lollipop plot/Cleveland dot plot{.tabset}

Lollipop plots and Cleveland dot plots are minimalist alternatives to bar plots. The key to both plots is to order the data based on the continuous variable using `arrange()` and then turn the discrete variable into a factor with the ordered levels of the continuous variable using `mutate()`. This step "stores" the order of the data. 

#### Lollipop plot

```{r lollipop-plot}
mtcars %>%
	rownames_to_column("model") %>%
	arrange(mpg) %>%
	mutate(model = factor(model, levels = .$model)) %>%
	ggplot(aes(mpg, model)) +
		geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = mpg, y = model, yend = model)) +	
		geom_point() +
		scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max(mtcars$mpg) * 1.1)) +
		labs(title = "Miles Per Gallon of Popular Cars",
				 subtitle = "1974 Motor Trend US magazine",
				 x = NULL, 
				 y = "Miles Per Gallon",
				 caption = "Urban Institute") +
	theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
```

#### Cleveland dot plot

```{r cleveland-dot-plot}
mtcars %>%
	rownames_to_column("model") %>%
	arrange(mpg) %>%
	mutate(model = factor(model, levels = .$model)) %>%
	ggplot(aes(mpg, model)) +
		geom_point() +
		scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max(mtcars$mpg) * 1.1)) +
		labs(title = "Miles Per Gallon of Popular Cars",
				 subtitle = "1974 Motor Trend US magazine",
				 x = NULL, 
				 y = "Miles Per Gallon",
				 caption = "Urban Institute") +
	theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
```

### Dumbell plot



## Scatter Plots

------

### One Color Scatter Plot

Scatter plots are useful for showing relationships between two or more variables. 

```{r one-color-scatter-plot}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "Diamond Prices Increase With Size",
       subtitle = "Diamond Prices in Dollars and Sizes in Carats",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price"
       )
```

### High-Density Scatter Plot with Transparency

Large numbers of observations can sometimes make scatter plots tough to interpret because points overlap. Adding `alpha = ` with a number between 0 and 1 adds transparency to points and clarity to plots. Now it's easy to see that jewelry stores are probably rounding up but not rounding down carats!

```{r alpha-scatter-plot}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.05) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "Diamond Prices Increase With Size",
       subtitle = "Diamond Prices in Dollars and Sizes in Carats",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price"
       )
```

### Hex Scatter Plot

Sometimes transparency isn't enough to bring clarity to a scatter plot with many observations. As n increases into the hundreds of thousands and even millions, `geom_hex` can be one of the best ways to display relationships between two variables. 

``` {r scatter-plot-hex}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_hex(mapping = aes(fill = ..count..)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::dollar) +
	scale_fill_gradientn(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Title",
       subtitle = "geom_hex adds clarity to overlapping points",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Price") +
  theme(legend.position = "right",
        legend.direction = "vertical")
```


### Scatter Plots With Random Noise{.tabset}

Sometimes scatter plots have many overlapping points but a reasonable number of observations. `geom_jitter` adds a small amount of random noise so points are less likely to overlap. `width` and `height` control the amount of noise that is added. In the following before-and-after, notice how many more points are visible after adding jitter.

#### Before
```{r before-scatter-plot}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_y_continuous() +
  labs(title = "Displacement and City MPG",
       subtitle = "Cars With Less Displacement Generally Get Better City MPG",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Displacement",
       y = "City MPG"
       )
```

#### After
```{r jitter-plot}
set.seed(2017)
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2) + 
  scale_y_continuous() +
  labs(title = "Displacement and City MPG",
       subtitle = "Cars With Less Displacement Generally Get Better City MPG",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Displacement",
       y = "City MPG"
       )
```

### Scatter Plot with Counts

Another option is to use `geom_count()` to add a size dimension to overlapping points.

```{r geom_count}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = cty)) + 
  geom_count() + 
  scale_y_continuous() +
  labs(title = "Displacement and City MPG",
       subtitle = "Cars With Less Displacement Generally Get Better City MPG",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Displacement",
       y = "City MPG"
  )
```

### Scatter Plots with Fill

A third aesthetic can be added to scatter plots. Here, color signifies the number of cylinders in each car. Before `ggplot()` is called, Cylinders is created using `library(dplyr)` and the piping operator `%>%`.

``` {r filled-scatter-plot}
mtcars %>%
  mutate(Cylinders = factor(cyl)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg, colour = Cylinders)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency Declines as Weight Increases",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Weight (Tons)",
       y = "Miles Per Gallon") +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0))
```

### Bubble Scatter Plot

`size =` can be used as a mapping to plot a fourth dimension. 

```{r bubble-chart}
mtcars %>%
  mutate(Cylinders = factor(cyl), `Automatic Transmission` = factor(am)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = `Automatic Transmission`, size = Cylinders)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency Declines as Weight Increases",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Weight (Tons)",
       y = "Miles Per Gallon") +
  theme(legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0))
```

## Line Plots

------

```{r line-plots}
ggplot(data = economics, mapping = aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Unemployment in the United States",
       subtitle = "Number of Unemployed Americans in the U.S.",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Number Unemployed (1,000s)")
```

### Lines Plots With Multiple Lines


```{r multiple-line-charts1}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gapminder %>%
	filter(country %in% c("Australia", "Canada", "New Zealand", "Japan")) %>%
	ggplot(aes(year, gdpPercap, color = country)) +
	geom_line() +
	scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),
										 labels = scales::dollar) +
	labs(title = "Per Capita GDP in Selected Countries",
			 subtitle = "From the gapminder data set",
			 caption = "Urban Institute",
			 x = "Year",
			 y = "Per capita GDP")



```

Plotting more than one variable can be useful for seeing the relationship of variables over time, but it takes a small amount of data munging. 

This is because `ggplot2` wants data in a "long" format instead of a "wide" format for line plots with multiple lines. `gather()` and `spread()` from the `tidyr` package make switching back-and-forth between "long" and "wide" painless. Essentially, variable titles go into "key" and variable values go into "value". Then ggplot2, turns the different levels of the key variable (population, unemployment) into colors. 

```{r multiple-line-charts2}
library(tidyverse)

as_tibble(EuStockMarkets) %>%
	mutate(date = time(EuStockMarkets)) %>%
	gather(key = "key", value = "value", -date) %>%
	ggplot(aes(date, value, color = key)) +
	geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), 
  									 labels = scales::dollar,
  									 limits = c(0, 10000)) +
	labs(title = "Major European Stock Indices",
			 subtitle = "Based on daily closing prices",
			 caption = "Urban Institute",
			 x = "Date",
			 y = "Value")
```

### Slope plots

```{r slope-plot}
# https://www.bls.gov/lau/

library(ggrepel)

unemployment <- tibble(
	time = c("October 2009", "October 2009", "October 2009", "August 2017", "August 2017", "August 2017"),
	rate = c(7.4, 7.1, 10.0, 3.9, 3.8, 6.4),
	state = c("Maryland", "Virginia", "Washington D.C.", "Maryland", "Virginia", "Washington D.C.")
)

label <- tibble(label = c("October 2009", "August 2017"))
october <- filter(unemployment, time == "October 2009")
august <- filter(unemployment, time == "August 2017")

unemployment %>%
	mutate(time = factor(time, levels = c("October 2009", "August 2017"))) %>%
	ggplot() + 
		geom_line(aes(time, rate, group = state, color = state)) +
		geom_point(aes(x = time, y = rate, color = state)) +
		labs(subtitle = "Unemployment Rate",
				 caption = "Source: BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics") +
		theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
					axis.title.x = element_blank(),
					axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
  	      axis.title.y = element_blank(), 
  	      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
					panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
  	      panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
  	      panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
					axis.line = element_blank()) +
		geom_text_repel(data = october, mapping = aes(x = time, y = rate, label = as.character(rate)), nudge_x = -0.06) + 
		geom_text_repel(data = august, mapping = aes(x = time, y = rate, label = as.character(rate)), nudge_x = 0.06)
```

## Univariate

------

There are a number of ways to explore the distributions of univariate data in R. Some methods, like strip charts, show all data points. Other methods, like the box and whisker plot, show selected data points that communicate key values like the median and 25th percentile. Finally, some methods don't show any of the underlying data but calculate density estimates. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, so it is worthwhile to understand the different forms. For more information, read [40 years of boxplots](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/boxplots.pdf) by Hadley Wickham and Lisa Stryjewski.

### Strip Chart

Strip charts, the simplest univariate plot, show the distribution of values along one axis. Strip charts work best with variables that have plenty of variation. If not, the points tend to cluster on top of each other. Even if the variable has plenty of variation, it is often important to add transparency to the points with `alpha = ` so overlapping values are visible. 

```{r stripchart, fig.height=2}
msleep %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_total, y = factor(1))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 5) +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = NULL) +
  labs(title = "Total Sleep Time of Different Mammals",
       caption = "Data from V. M. Savage and G. B. West",
       x = "Total sleep time (hours)",
       y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

```

### Strip Chart with Highlighting

Because strip charts show all values, they are useful for showing where selected points lie in the distribution of a variable. The clearest way to do this is by adding `geom_point()` twice with `filter()` in the data argument. This way, the highlighted values show up on top of unhighlighted values. 

```{r stripchart with highlighting, fig.height=2}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = filter(msleep, name != "Red fox"), 
                    aes(x = sleep_total, 
                        y = factor(1)),
             alpha = 0.2, 
             size = 5,
  					 color = "grey50") +
  geom_point(data = filter(msleep, name == "Red fox"),
             aes(x = sleep_total, 
                 y = factor(1), 
                 color = name),
             alpha = 0.8,
             size = 5) +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = NULL) +
  labs(title = "Total Sleep Time of Different Mammals",
       caption = "Data from V. M. Savage and G. B. West",
       x = "Total sleep time (hours)",
       y = NULL,
       legend) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = NULL)) +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

### Subsetted Strip Chart 

Add a y variable to see the distributions of the continuous variable in subsets of a categorical variable. 

```{r subsetted stripchart, fig.height=3}
library(forcats)

msleep %>%
  filter(!is.na(vore)) %>%
  mutate(vore = fct_recode(vore, 
                            "Insectivore" = "insecti",
                            "Omnivore" = "omni", 
                            "Herbivore" = "herbi", 
                            "Carnivore" = "carni"
                            )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sleep_total, y = vore)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2, size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Total Sleep Time of Different Mammals by Diet",
       caption = "Data from V. M. Savage and G. B. West",
       x = "Total sleep time (hours)",
       y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

### Histograms

Histograms divide the distribution of a variable into n equal-sized bins and then count and display the number of observations in each bin. Histograms are sensitive to bin width. As `?geom_histogram` notes, "You should always override [the default binwidth] value, exploring multiple widths to find the best to illustrate the stories in your data."

```{r histogram}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = depth)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Diamond Depths",
       caption = "Urban Institute", 
       x = "Depth",
       y = "Count")
```

### Boxplots

Boxplots were invented in the 1970s by John Tukey[^1]. Instead of showing the underlying data or binned counts of the underlying data, they focus on important values like the 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile. 

```{r box-plot}
ggplot(InsectSprays, aes(x = spray, y = count)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Insects Killed by Insect Sprays",
       caption = "Urban Institute", 
       x = "Type of Insect Spray",
       y = "Number of Dead Insects")
```

### Smoothed Kernel Density Plots

Continuous variables with smooth distributions are sometimes better represented with smoothed kernel density estimates than histograms or boxplots. `geom_density()` computes and plots a kernel density estimate. Notice the lumps around integers and halves in the following distribution because of rounding. 

```{r kernel density plot}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat)) +
  geom_density() +
	scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Carats",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Density")
```

```{r kernel density plot filled}
diamonds %>%
  mutate(cost = ifelse(price > 5500, "More than $5,500 +", "$0 to $5,500")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(carat, fill = cost)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.25) +
	scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Carats",
       x = "Carat",
       y = "Density")
```

### Ridgeline Plots

Ridgeline plots are partially overlapping smoothed kernel density plots faceted by a categorical variable that pack a lot of information into one elegant plot. 

```{r ridgeline-plots}
library(ggridges)

ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price, y = cut)) +
	geom_density_ridges(fill = "#1696d2") +
	scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Diamond Prices by Diamond Cut",
       caption = "Urban Institue",
       x = "Price",
       y = "Cut")
```

### Violin Plots

Violin plots are symmetrical displays of smooth kernel density plots. 

```{r violin plot}
ggplot(InsectSprays, aes(x = spray, y = count, fill = spray)) +
  geom_violin() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Insects Killed by Insect Sprays",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Type of Insect Spray",
       y = "Number of Dead Insects")
```

### Bean Plot

Individual outliers and important summary values are not visible in violin plots or smoothed kernel density plots. Bean plots, [created by Peter Kampstra in 2008](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v028c01), are violin plots with data shown as small lines in a one-dimensional sstrip plot and larger lines for the mean. 

```{r beanplot}
msleep %>%
  filter(!is.na(vore)) %>%
  mutate(vore = fct_recode(vore, 
                            "Insectivore" = "insecti",
                            "Omnivore" = "omni", 
                            "Herbivore" = "herbi", 
                            "Carnivore" = "carni"
                            )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = vore, y = sleep_total, fill = vore)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y= "mean",
              colour = "black", 
              size = 30,
              shape = 95,
              geom = "point") +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0,
              height = 0.05,
              alpha = 0.4,
              shape = "-",
              size = 10,
  						color = "grey50") +
    labs(title = "Total Sleep Time of Different Mammals by Diet",
       caption = "Data from V. M. Savage and G. B. West",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Total sleep time (hours)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Area Plot

------

### Stacked Area
```{r area plot stack}
txhousing %>%
  filter(city %in% c("Austin","Houston","Dallas","San Antonio","Fort Worth")) %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  summarize(sales = sum(sales)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sales, fill = city)) +
    geom_area(position = "stack") +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::comma) +
    labs(title = "Home Sales in Texas Cities",
         caption = "Urban Institute",
         x = "Year",
         y = "Home Sales")
```

### Filled Area
```{r area plot fill}
txhousing %>%
  filter(city == "Austin" | city == "Houston"| city == "Dallas"| city == "San Antonio" | city == "Fort Worth") %>%
  group_by(city, year) %>%
  summarize(listings = sum(listings)) %>%
  mutate(listings = ifelse(is.na(listings), lag(listings), listings)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = listings, fill = city)) +
    geom_area(position = "fill") +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::comma) +
    labs(title = "Home Listings in Texas Cities",
         caption = "Urban Institute",
         x = "Year",
         y = "Proportion of Home Listings")
```

## Waffle Chart / Square Pie Chart

------

The waffle package {[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/waffle/waffle.pdf) and [Github](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle)} creates suare pie charts. It can also be combined with [glyphs](http://fontawesome.io/) for more elegant shapes than squares. This example uses data pulled from [A Vision for an Equitable DC](http://www.urban.org/features/vision-equitable-dc).

Waffle charts will require a little extra tinkering since they are called from `library(waffle)` instead of `library(ggplot2)`. Most importantly, waffle charts require `theme_urban(text = element_text(family = "Lato"))` for the Lato font. 

### Single Waffle Chart

```{r single waffle}
library(waffle)

parts <- c(`Virginia\nClinics` = (1000 - 208 - 105), `Maryland\nClinics` = 208, `D.C.\nClinics` = 105)
waffle(parts, rows = 25, size = 1, colors = c("#1696d2", "#fdbf11", "#000000"), legend_pos = "bottom") +
  labs(title = "Free Clinics in the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia Area",
       subtitle = "1 Square == 1 Clinic",
       caption = "Urban Institute") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Lato"))
```

### Waffle Charts with Glyphs

Waffle charts can be enhanced by replacing squares qith glyphs. Two important arguments to know are `glyph_size =` and `use_glyph =`. Both are called in the `waffle()` function. Note: `size = 1` is sensible and `glyph_size = 12` is sensible. 

Using glyphs requires downloading fontawesome. That can be done [here](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle/tree/master/inst/fonts). Then run `library(extrafont)`, 
`port(<font-location>)`, and `loadfonts()` once. After that, building waffle charts with glpyhs should be as easy as one function call. 

```{r waffle with glyphs}
library(extrafont)
#font_import("H:/IT/urban_R_theme/docs")
#loadfonts()

parts <- c(`Virginia\nClinics` = (50 - 10 - 5), `Maryland\nClinics` = 10, `D.C.\nClinics` = 5)
waffle(parts, rows = 5, glyph_size = 12, colors = c("#1696d2", "#fdbf11", "#000000"), legend_pos = "bottom", use_glyph = "medkit") +
  labs(title = "Free Clinics in the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia Area",
       subtitle = "1 Square == 20 Clinics",
       caption = "Urban Institute") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Lato"))

```

### Multiple Waffle Charts

`library(waffle)` allows multiple waffle charts to be ironed together using `iron()`. Ironing multiple charts together requires some trial-and-error to get the sizes and resolution to look good, but the results can be worth the work. Don't forget `theme(text = element_text(family = "Lato"))`!

```{r ironed waffle}
library(waffle)

white <- c(`With Degree` = 169300, `Without Degree` = 800)
black <- c(`With Degree` = 174900, `Without Degree` = 34700)
hispanic <- c(`With Degree` = 27700, `Without Degree` = 12400)

iron(
  waffle(white / 83, rows = 40, size = 0.25, colors = c("#1696d2", "#fdbf11"), title = "White", keep = FALSE, pad = 10) + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Lato")),
  waffle(black / 83, rows = 40, size = 0.25, colors = c("#1696d2", "#fdbf11"), title = "Black", keep = FALSE) + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Lato")),
  waffle(hispanic / 83, rows = 40, size = 0.25, colors = c("#1696d2", "#fdbf11"), title = "Hispanic", keep = FALSE, pad = 59, xlab = "1 Square == 83 People") + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Lato"))
) 
```

## Heat map

------

```{r heat map, fig.height=10}
library(fivethirtyeight)

bad_drivers %>%
  mutate(`Number of Drivers` = scale(num_drivers),
         `Percent Speeding` = scale(perc_speeding),
         `Percent Alcohol` = scale(perc_alcohol),
         `Percent Not Distracted` = scale(perc_not_distracted),
         `Percent No Previous` = scale(perc_no_previous),
         state = factor(state, levels = rev(state))
         ) %>%
  select(-insurance_premiums, -losses, -(num_drivers:losses)) %>%
  gather(`Number of Drivers`:`Percent No Previous`, key = "variable", value = "SD's from Mean") %>%
  ggplot(aes(variable, state)) +
    geom_tile(aes(fill = `SD's from Mean`)) +
    labs(title = "Drivers Involved in Fatal Collisions By Behavior",
      subtitle = "As a share of scaled fatal collisions per billion miles, 2009",
      caption = "Source: fivethirtyeight R package",
      x = NULL,
      y = NULL) + 
    scale_fill_gradientn() +
    theme(legend.position = "right",
      legend.direction = "vertical",
      axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
#https://learnr.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/ggplot2-quick-heatmap-plotting/

```

## Faceting and Small Multiples

------

### facet_wrap()

R's faceting system is a powerful way to make "small multiples".

Some edits to the theme may be necessary depending upon how many rows and columns are in the plot. 

```{r small multiples, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 9}
# Facet Wrap
txhousing %>%
  filter(!city %in% c("Brazoria County", "Brownsville", "San Angelo", "Denton County")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = median)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~city) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(title = "Median Monthly Home Prices in Selected Texas Cities",
       x = "Median Monthly Home Value",
       y = "Count") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
        strip.text = element_text(face = "plain", 
                              size = rel(0.5)))
```

### facet_grid()

``` {r faceting}
## Facet Grid
mtcars %>%
	mutate(vs = factor(vs, levels = 0:1, labels = c("Normal Transmission", "V/S Transmission")),
				 am = factor(am, levels = 0:1, labels = c("Automatic Transmission", "Manual Transmission"))) %>%
	ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) +
		geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
		scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 45)) +
  	labs(title = "Determinants of Fuel Efficiency", 
  			 subtitle = "1974 Motor Trends US magazine data", 
  		caption = "Urban Institute") +
  	facet_grid(vs ~ am, margins = TRUE) +
		theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA, size = 0.3))
```

## Smoothers

------

`geom_smooth()` fits and plots models to data with two or more dimensions. 

```{r geom_smooth}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
	geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Understanding and manipulating defaults is more important for `geom_smooth()` than other geoms because it contains a number of assumptions. `geom_smooth()` automatically uses loess for datasets with fewer than 1,000 observations and 
a generalized additive model with `formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")` for datasets with greater than 1,000 observations. Both default to a 95% confidence interval with the confidence interval displayed. 

Models are chosen with `method = ` and can be set to lm(), glm(), gam(), loess(), rlm(), and more. Formulas can be specified with `formula = ` and `y ~ x` syntax. Plotting the standard error is toggled with `se = TRUE` and `se = FALSE`, and level is specificed with `level = `. As always, more information can be seen in RStudio with `?geom_smooth()`.

`geom_point()` adds a scatterplot to `geom_smooth()`. The order of the function calls is important. The function called second will be layed on top of the function called first. 

```{r geom_smooth2}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
	geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
	geom_smooth(color =  "#ec008b") +
	scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::dollar)
```

`geom_smooth` can be subset by categorical and factor variables. This requires subgroups to have a decent number of observations and and a fair amount of variability across the x-axis. Confidence intervals often widen at the ends so special care is needed for the chart to be meaningful and readable. 

```{r subset geom_smooth}

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(cyl))) +
	geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
	geom_smooth() +
	labs(title = "Engine Displacement and City MPG by Number of Cylinders",
			 subtitle = "Loess: MPG = Displacement",
			 caption = "Urban Institute",
			 x = "Engine Displacement",
			 y = "Highway MPG")

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
	geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
	geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
	labs(title = "Engine Displacement and City MPG by Drive",
			 subtitle = "Linear Model: MPG = Displacement",
			 caption = "Urban Institute",
			 x = "Engine Displacement",
			 y = "Highway MPG")

```


## Highlighting

lines

## Text and Annotation

------

Several functions can be used to annotate, label, and highlight different parts of plots. `geom_text()` and `geom_text_repel()` both display variables from data frames. `annotate()`, which has several different uses, displays variables and values included in the function call. 

### geom_text()

`geom_text()` turns text variables in data sets into geometric objects. This is useful for labeling data in plots. Both functions need `x` values and `y` values to determine placement on the coordinate plane, and a text vector of labels. 

This can be used to label `geom_bar()`. 

```{r bar-geom_text}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarize(price = mean(price)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(cut, price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::dollar(price)), vjust = -1) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),
  									 labels = scales::dollar,
                     limits = c(0, 5000)) +
  labs(title = "Average Diamond Price by Diamond Cut",
       x = "Cut",
       y = "Price")
```

It can also be used to label points in a scatter plot. 

It's rarely useful to label every point in a scatter plot. Use `filter()` to create a second data set that is subsetted and pass it into the labelling function. 

```{r scatterplot-geom_text}
labels <- mtcars %>%
	rownames_to_column("model") %>%
	filter(model %in% c("Toyota Corolla", "Merc 240D", "Datsun 710"))

mtcars %>%
	ggplot(mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
		geom_point() +
		geom_text(data = labels, mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg, label = model), nudge_x = 0.38) +
	  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency Declines as Weight Increases",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Weight (Tons)",
       y = "Miles Per Gallon")
```

Text too often overlaps with other text or geoms when using `geom_text()`. `library(ggrepel)` is a `library(ggplot2)` add-on that automatically positions text so it doesn't overlap with geoms or other text. To add this functionality, install and load `library(ggrepel)` and then use `geom_text_repel()` with the same syntax as `geom_text()`. 

### geom_text_repel()

```{r scatterplot-geom_text_repel}
library(ggrepel)

labels <- mtcars %>%
	rownames_to_column("model") %>%
	top_n(5, mpg)

mtcars %>%
	ggplot(mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
		geom_point() +
		geom_text_repel(data = labels, 
		                mapping = aes(label = model), 
		                nudge_x = 0.38) +
	  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency Declines as Weight Increases",
       caption = "Urban Institute",
       x = "Weight (Tons)",
       y = "Miles Per Gallon")
```

### annotate()

`annotate()` doesn't use data frames. Instead, it takes values for `x =` and `y =`. It can add text, rectangles, segments, and pointrange. 

```{r annotate point}
msleep %>%
  filter(bodywt < 1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(bodywt, sleep_total)) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate("text", x = 500, y = 12, label = "These data suggest that heavy \n animals sleep less than light animals") +
  labs(title = "The relationship between mammal weight and sleep",
       x = "Body weight (pounds)",
       y = "Sleep time (hours)")
```

```{r annotate rect}
library(AmesHousing)

ames <- make_ames()

ames %>%
  mutate(square_footage = Total_Bsmt_SF - Bsmt_Unf_SF + First_Flr_SF + Second_Flr_SF) %>%
  mutate(Sale_Price = Sale_Price / 1000) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(square_footage, Sale_Price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),
                     limits = c(0, 800), 
                     labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma,
                     breaks = c(0, 5000, 10000)) +  
  labs(title = "Home Sales Prices in Ames, Iowa", 
       x = "Square footage", 
       y = "Sale price (thousands)") +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 6800, xmax = 11500, ymin = 145, ymax = 210, alpha = 0.1) +
  annotate("text", x = 8750, y = 230, label = "Unfinished homes")
```

## Layered Geoms

------

Geoms can be layered in `ggplot2`. This is useful for design and analysis. 

It is often useful to add points to line plots with a small number of values across the x-axis. This example from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) shows how changing the line to grey can be appealing. 

### Design{.tabset}

#### Before
```{r layering geoms design}
table1 %>%
	ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases)) +
		geom_line(aes(color = country)) +
		geom_point(aes(color = country)) +
		scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
		scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2000)) +
		labs(title = "Changes in Tuberculosis Cases in Three Countries",
					 caption = "Source: World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Report")
```

#### After
```{r layering geoms design grey}
table1 %>%
	ggplot(aes(year, cases)) +
		geom_line(aes(group = country), color = "grey50") +
		geom_point(aes(color = country)) +
		scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
		scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999, 2000)) +
		labs(title = "Changes in Tuberculosis Cases in Three Countries",
					 caption = "Source: World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Report")
```

Layering geoms is also useful for adding trend lines and centroids to scatter plots. 

```{r layers}
# Simple line
# Regression model
# Centroids
```

### Centroids

```{r centroids}
mpg_summary <- mpg %>%
	group_by(cyl) %>%
	summarize(displ = mean(displ), cty = mean(cty))

mpg %>%
	ggplot() +
		geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = cty, color = factor(cyl)), alpha = 0.5) +
		geom_point(data = mpg_summary, aes(x = displ, y = cty), size = 5, color = "red") +
		geom_text(data = mpg_summary, aes(x = displ, y = cty, label = cyl)) +
		labs(title = "City MPG, Engine Displacement, and Number of Cylinders", 
				 subtitle = "Subgroup Means in Red", 
				 caption = "Source: EPA Fuel Economy Dataset", 
				 x = "Displacement",
				 y = "City MPG")
```

## Saving Plots

------

`ggsave()` exports ggplot2 plots. The function can be used in two ways. If `plot =` isn't specified in the function call, then `ggsave()` automatically saves the plot that was last displayed in the Viewer window. Second, if `plot =` is specified, then `ggsave()` saves the specified plot. `ggsave()` guesses the type of graphics device to use in export (.png, .pdf, .svg, etc.) from the file extension in the filename. 

```{r ggsave, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave(filename = "cars.png")

plot2 <- mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave(filename = "cars.png", plot = plot2)
```

Exported plots rarely look identical to the plots that show up in the Viewer window in RStudio because the overall size and aspect ratio of the Viewer is often different than the defaults for `ggsave()`. Specific sizes, aspect ratios, and resolutions can be controlled with arguments in `ggsave()`. RStudio has a useful [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) called "How Big is Your Graph?" that should help with choosing the best size, aspect ratio, and resolution. 

In general, .svg files appear crisper than .png or .pdf files. However, .png and .pdf are more stable in web browsers.
